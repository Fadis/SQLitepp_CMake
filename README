This is the CMake version of SQLite++ modified by Naomasa Matsubayashi.
Original SQLite++ written by Pavel Medevdev uses bjam to build.
Sadly, original jamfile didn't work on MacOSX ( it requires GNU ld specific option ).
Since Boost.Build jamfile is too complex and difficult to customize at least for me,
I made it to build using CMake.

Requirements
SQLite3 ( http://www.sqlite.org/ )

Installation
$ git clone git://github.com/Fadis/SQLitepp_CMake.git
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../SQLitepp_CMake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>
$ make
$ make insetll

Library approaches with binding variables to SQL queries was inspired by
